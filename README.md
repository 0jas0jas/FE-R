## PROJECT DESCRIPTION

Conditions such as agoraphobia, the fear of being in public spaces, and severe social anxiety are more common than you think. In fact, 2% of the population experience gut-wrenching fear at the thought of leaving the house1. This prevents patients from completing even the most basic, necessary tasks, such as grocery shopping. Studies have shown that these patients often suffer from pathological anxiety and chronic stress which can lead to structural degeneration of the hippocampus and prefrontal cortexâ€”increasing the risk of developing neuropsychiatric disorders, including depression and dementia.


Our proposed project offers you the chance to conquer your phobia with a virtual buddy. Nevr Fear is a virtual reality program designed to help patients take back control of their lives. During exposure therapy, healthcare professionals can help patients to combat their fears from the comfort of their homes.


Nevr Fear allows patients to accomplish their goals at their own pace. Each level is carefully curated to help patients reach milestones that would otherwise be harder to accomplish in an external environment. They will be experiencing gradients of exposure of the outside world.  Moreover, each milestone is celebrated by unlocking levels from apprentice to expert and encouraging patients to push their boundaries further.


Although still novel, promising results have been demonstrated in using VR for exposure therapy. Clinical trials have shown that success in the treatment leads to significant observable as well as patient-reported behavioural change in real-life situations. Turn to Step into Courage to conquer your fear with VR.
